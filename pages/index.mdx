# UIUC Grade Statistics Dashboard

Your home to get advanced statistics about every course at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

## Inspiration

This website was inspired by the report ["Grade disparity between sections at UIUC"](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/). While the report is very useful in finding grade disparities between teachers in classes, it falls short in showing the distribution of grades in those courses. That's where this website comes into play. Using the same [GPA dataset](https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets/tree/master/gpa), this website displays the distribution of GPAs for a given course over a period of time as a histogram and a sunburst chart.

## Usage

To get started, go to /my-courses by clicking on the link that says "my courses" on the side menu. You should be greeted with this screen.

To add a course, click the link that says "Add course." You should see a confirmation pop up. If you want to a remove a course, just click on the link that says "Remove course." You will see a similiar confirmation popup. Once you are satisfied with the courses you've added, go back to the courses dashboard by linking on the "My Courses" link.

You should now see a page with filled with pairs of graphs. Here is an example graph for MATH 220: Calculus. If at any point you want to remove a course, just press the red button at the bottom of the graphs.

## Contributing

This website was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with Incremental Static Regeneration. The histogram and sunburst charts are made using [Plotly's JavaScript library](https://plotly.com/javascript/). All of the code can be found on my github repository [here](https://github.com/i-am-zach/uiuc-grade-stats). If there is a typo on any of the pages or you should like to implement a new feature, please feel free to create a new pull request to make the website better!
