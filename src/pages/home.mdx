- Filter by professors in courses to see how they change the grade distribution of a class
- Specifiy a custom year range (2010-2020)

## Coming Soon

- Find the "easiest" and "hardest" professor for each course
- Get the probability of getting a certain GPA given the courses a student is taking
- Game mode: be given two different courses at UIUC and try to guess which class has the higher median GPA

# Guide

To view statistics about each course at the University, navigate to <RouterLink to="/my-courses"><Link color="blue.400">My Courses</Link></RouterLink>. If this is your first time on the website, you should see a message that says "Oh no! You have no courses" with a button below it. Click on the button and that will take you to the course catalog. Once you add courses, you will see this page populate with graphs about those courses.

## Searching for a Course

To search for a course, it must be in the specific format: `{SUBJECT} {NUMBER}` where `SUBJECT` is the course's subject in all capital letters and `NUMBER` is the course's corresponding number. If you type in a course's subject in lowercase letters or try to type in the course's title, no results will appear.

## Adding and Removing Courses

Adding a course is as simple as pressing the "Add course" or "Remove course" button on the bottom of the search for the desired course.

# Inspiration

This website was inspired by the report ["Grade disparity between sections at UIUC"](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/) and uses the same [GPA dataset](https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets/tree/master/gpa) to display data about the grade distrubtions of different courses at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
